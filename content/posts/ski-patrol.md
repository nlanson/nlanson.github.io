It's been a while since I've last touched this website. I had an article about telemark skiing half written up which I 
left to brew and then I totally forgot about it....

Anyhow, it's been a year since the last post (in which I hadn't written much), but I thought I'd post a quick update on what I'm doing nowadays with my life:


Recently, after two and a half years of study, I left University. I was studying computer science (yeah no shit) and even had a cushy government job in the sector but I left all of that behind me and moved south to the deep highlands of Kosciuszko NP to pursue a hobby of mine in a professional capacity.

I am now a ski patroller for an (almost snowless) ski resort within the national park, living right in front of the slopes with 5 other legends. The work is much more intense and challenging that what I used to do, and I get a kick out it. No more waiting on blockers because the dev team fucked up our automation environment or drooling through long teams meetings filled with words and acronyms that meant nothing to me. Work now involves making sure skiers have fun while staying safe and taking care of any injured patients until the Ambo arrives from the closest town almost 1.5 hours away.

The pay is shit and management is cheap but the work is fun, challenging and makes me feel required.

Maybe one day I will go back to finish my degree and get back into the tech industry but for now, I am happy and fulfilled, living within the landscape I love.

As for this site, now that I have rediscovered it, I'll start looking for interesting topics to write about. I've learnt some pretty neat things in software security recently so I might go into one of the CTF challenges I solved or something... Or maybe a post a out skiing. We'll see in the near future....

Ciao
