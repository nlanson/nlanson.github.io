Hi everyone! Welcome to my webpage.



This will be the place where I write short, almost journal like, entries on things that I come across in my life. Topics include but are not limited to computer programming, telemark skiing, cool history facts and more...

The page layout and config is still under configuration. I am new to Hugo and am figuring it out as I go so expect the page to change as I get more time to work on it.

My first post will likely be about how nice it was to work with Hugo, or it could be about skiing, who knows!

Stay tuned for more...
